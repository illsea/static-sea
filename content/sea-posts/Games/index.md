### Canonfall

The math terrorists are infecting our beatiful letters and words with icky numbers and formulas! Fire up your cannon and blast these usurpers out of the sky. They're tricky buggers, but if you know your parts of speech, they're easy to find. In this demo, you're planing Noun Down in Canonfall. Flick your finger from the cannon toward any noun to shoot it down before it explodes. You'll pretty much have to read a real book and understand the words, in and out of context or you'll get blow'd up. Right now, you're reading Chapter 1 from the Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.
