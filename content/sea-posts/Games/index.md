### Canonfall

The math separatists are infecting our beatiful letters and words with icky numbers and formulas! Fire up your cannon and blast these usurpers out of the sky. They're tricky buggers, but if you know your parts of speech, they're easy to find. In this way-too-early to release development build, you're playing ***Noun Down*** in ***Canonfall!*** Flick your finger from the cannon toward any noun to shoot it down before it explodes. You'll pretty much have to read a real book and understand the words, in and out of context or you'll get blow'd up. For now, you're reading Chapter 1 from the Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. No instructions, scoring, menus, sounds, music, or anything else yet! Despite that, it took quite a bit of effort to do the natural language processing and game server, and I believe the framework to be rock solid. I had to learn Python and a few other things to get the back-end going, but with that in place, my system is capable of gamefying any work of English literature you throw at it. Probably other languages, too, if properly trained. It's not really ready for having fun yet, so have at it!
