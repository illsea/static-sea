# I'm a one man indie games, software, and audio studio.

I write, play, and produce both music and software by my lonesome. My formal education is in English, but I prefer writing software. While I'm running a business, this site also serves as a portion of my portfolio. I'm looking to switch gears from sales into a proper technical role.

To that end, **[here's a copy of my resume.](/resume.pdf)** Feel free to hire me!
